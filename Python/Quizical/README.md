# Quizical
Web application that allows students to quickly learn new content and memorize information. All you have to do is upload your (text) notes to the website/server, and the program will take care of everything else for you. Quizical will test your knowledge by creating and endless amount of multiple choice and fill in the blank questions. This is the best way to study; by taking action!

# Inspiration
If you are learning to drive, is it better to read hundreds of books or drive hundreds of miles? The answer is obvious: *Just Do It*. So why should learning be any different? This is the motivation behind creating Quizical. Reading is a very monotonous task. The average person can only read for an hour before getting bored or losing concentration. This is because humans did not evolve to sit still and read. We were made to take action. With Quizical, you can study anytime, anyplace.

# Release
Status: Coming Soon \
*This will take some time, because I need to sort through terabytes of information across 6 HDDS. Unfortunately, searching via grep will not work, because for some reason - at the time - I thought encrypting everything is a good idea.* \
*Also, only the first version will be released. The subsequent versions will be kept private because the technology is phenomenal and, in the right environment, can be commercialized.*

# TLDR
Quizical is like Quizlet with automation. Your notes go in and questions come out. Nobody has to spend countless hours creating practice questions; the program does it for you! \
