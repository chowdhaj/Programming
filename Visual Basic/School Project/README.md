## Synopsis
This application is a covert Halo & Counterstrike launcher. It is designed
to play Halo/Counterstrike in a windowed mode inside of a window that looks
Microsoft Word or Microsoft PowerPoint. Secret keywords like "Play" and
"Patch" are used to trigger the executable and terminate it. Upon exit,
all traces of either game are wiped. The games are launched via a self-
executing ZIP that is designed to be portable. Meaning, it does not install
any files to the local storage. All files are temporary and the application
ensures the deletion of permanent files like *Saved Profiles*.

* BMI Calculator
* Height Converter
* Weight Converter

As a bonus, it can play music. Just press the music icon to get started.
To start/stop playback, use the appropriate volume buttons. To exit the
application entirely, press the lock button on the iPhone 4.

## Executable
The executables are too large to host on *GitHub*, and I'm running out of
space. The total size of the *EXE* are ~171 MB and ~91 MB, respectively.
If you would like a copy, please send me a message, and I will be happy
to send you the respective executable. Thank you!
