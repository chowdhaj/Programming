## Synopsis
This application is a BMI calculator, height and weight converter. It is 
presented inside a makeshift iPhone 4 simulator. The entire application
is built in (VB) .NET. While it does not have the full functionality of an
iPhone, it's design is nearly 1:1 of an iPhone 4 running iOS 5. As a bonus,
the application is loaded with funny Easter Eggs. The main apps are:

* BMI Calculator
* Height Converter
* Weight Converter

As a bonus, it can play music. Just press the music icon to get started.
To start/stop playback, use the appropriate volume buttons. To exit the
application entirely, press the lock button on the iPhone 4.

## Images
1. Upon starting the program, you are greeted with a peculiar splash screen.
   The combination of grungey colors and lens flares gives off a *Star Trek*
   vibe. \

2. A simple line animation, which is *The Vortex*. Here it is done in red.
   You can use the menu on the side to play any 2D animation you want. \

3. The background color can be changed. In this instance, it was changed from
   white to black, and the *Extreme Grid* animation is executed. Notice how
   even the lines' color can be altered - here it is green. \

4. This might be the worst color combination in the world; blue and burgundy.
   At least the makeshift parabolic curves look nice. If you look closely,
   there's a *Parabola* on each side. \

5. The source code for each 2D line animation can be retrieved from the menu
   bar *(i.e. Developer Logs)*. Here we have partial source for *Quad
   Parabola*. \
