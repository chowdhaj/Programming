## Synopsis
This application is a BMI calculator, height and weight converter. It is 
presented inside a makeshift iPhone 4 simulator. The entire application
is built in (VB) .NET. While it does not have the full functionality of an
iPhone, it's design is nearly 1:1 of an iPhone 4 running iOS 5. As a bonus,
the application is loaded with funny Easter Eggs. The main apps are:

* BMI Calculator
* Height Converter
* Weight Converter

As a bonus, it can play music. Just press the music icon to get started.
To start/stop playback, use the appropriate volume buttons. To exit the
application entirely, press the lock button on the iPhone 4.

## Images
1. The on-screen controls function very similar to an iPhone. Press the
   power button to exit the application. The home button terminates the
   app you are in. Pressing the notification bar brings down information.
   The volume buttons control music; just like regular phones. \

2. The BMI app calculates your body mass index. Input your name, weight,
   and height, and the app will do the rest for you. You can choose
   between Metric or Imperial units. *Note: There is an Easter Egg here.
   See if you can find it!* \

3. The background color can be changed. In this instance, it was changed from
   white to black, and the *Extreme Grid* animation is executed. Notice how
   even the lines' color can be altered - here it is green. \

4. This might be the worst color combination in the world; blue and burgundy.
   At least the makeshift parabolic curves look nice. If you look closely,
   there's a *Parabola* on each side. \

5. The source code for each 2D line animation can be retrieved from the menu
   bar *(i.e. Developer Logs)*. Here we have partial source for *Quad
   Parabola*. \
