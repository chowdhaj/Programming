# Computer Science & Software Engineer Notes

Here are a few notes I made when learning the rudimentaries of various programming languages.
In my experience, spend less time watching tutorials and more time doing. This is the best
way to learn programming/engineering. Learn the basics, then set out to do what seems to
be an impossible task, like creating a video game.

Some of these notes were created during my undergraduate career. For instance, I needed to
learn Haskell, and YouTube is where I started my journey. But once I got the hang of it,
I started creating applications, and stopped watching tutorials.
