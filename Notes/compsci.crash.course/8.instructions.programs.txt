Notes
-----

- A CPU (hardware) is powerful because it is programmable (software); can perform user instructions
- Instructions are in memory (i.e. RAM), and then loaded into the CPU (registers)
- An infinite loop is when a program runs forever
- Instruction length is the size of the opcode (i.e. 32-bit, 64-bit, etc.)
- In 1971, Intel released the 4004, the first CPU that put everything into a single chip. It supported 46 instructions
