Notes
-----

- Computer hardware can only handle raw binary instructions (1s and 0s). This language is called Machine Language OR Machine Code
- An informal high-level description of a program is called Pseudo-Code
- An Assembler converts text-based instructions and assembles them into corresponding binary instructions automatically. It reads assembly language and converts it to native machine code
- Each assembly language instruction converts directly to a corresponding machine instruction - a one to one mapping
- The phrase "patching a program" comes from applying patches of paper over the holes on punch cards
- A Compiler transforms source code written in a programming language into a low-level language like assembly or machine code
- A Compiler takes care of allocating memory, handling registers, and other minute detail and abstractions
- Fortran, derived from Formula Translation, was the first widely used programming language
- COBOL, Common Business-Oriented Language, was made to unify programming across a wide range of computers and architectures
- The notion "Write Once, Run Anywhere" allows you to run your source code on any computer, regardless of architecture
