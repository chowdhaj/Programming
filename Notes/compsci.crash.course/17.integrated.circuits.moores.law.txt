- Within 50 years, software grew in complexity from machine code punched by hand onto paper tape, to object oriented programming languages, compiled in integrated development environments
- From the 1940s to the through the 1960s every computer was built from individual parts called discrete components, which were all wired together
- Transistorized computers marked the second generation of electronic computing; the first was vacuum tubes
- Integrated circuit consists of all the discrete components, packaged into one component
- Robert Noyce is widely regarded as the father of modern Integrated Circuits
- Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) have all the metal wires etched right into them, to connect components together
- Photolithography uses light to transfer complex patterns to a material, like a semiconductor. It can be used to create complex circuits
- Silicon is a semiconductor because it can sometimes conduct electricity and other times it does not
- Photolithography is used to control where and when a silicon wafer can conduct electricity. The wafer is also used as a base to lay down complex metal circuits, so everything is integrated; hence the name Integrated Circuits (IC)
- During photolithography, chemicals are used to etch patterns onto the silicon wafer
- According to Moore's Law, approximately every 2 years, you can fit twice the number of transistors into the same amount of space, due to advancements in materials and manufacturing
- The smaller the transistor, the less charge you have to move around, allowing it to switch states faster and consume less power
- More compact circuits results in less delay in signals, resulting in faster clock speeds
- In 1968, Robert Noyce and Gordan Moore teamed up and founded a new company, combining the words Integrated and Electronics - Intel - the largest chip maker today
- The Intel 4004 was the first processor that shipped as an IC; referred to as a microprocessor
- The era of integrated circuits, especially microprocessors, ushered in the 3rd generation of computing
- Improvements to photolithography resulted in all components of a computer benefitting; RAM, GPU, SSD, etc.
- Starting in the 1970s, very-large-scale integration, or VLSI software, has been used to automatically generate chip designs. Marking the start of the 4th generation of computers
- Experts have been predicting the end of Moore's Law for decades, because:
	1. We're bumping into limits on how fine we can make features on a photomask and it's resulting wafer due to the wavelengths of light used in photolithography. To combat this, scientists are developing smaller wavelengths of light that can project smaller features
	2. When transistors get really small, where electrodes are separated by a few dozen atoms, electrons can jump the gap. This phenomenon is called quantum tunneling. If transistors leak currents, they don't make very good switches
