Notes
-----

- The vision of ubiquitous computing is integrating computers into daily life, putting them in your fridge, pants, bed, etc.
- Computers today have computing power in proportion to a mouse
- Computers might bridge the gap between computational power and the human brain by 2025
- Computers might have more processing power than the sum of all human brains by 2050
- The Singularity is the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life. When AI becomes smarter than humans, we'll have reached the Singularity
- Some experts believe this progress is going to level off and be more of an S curve than an exponential one, where as complexity increases, it becomes more difficult to make additional progress
- Many job sectors will be rendered obsolete by computers like AIs and Robots, that can do their work better and for less pay
- AI is gonna be even more disruptive than the industrial revolution
- There are 4 different types of jobs:
	1. Routine Manual: Factory workers
	2. Non-Routine Manual: Cooks
	3. Routine Cognitive: Bank tellers
	4. Non-Routine Cognitive: Doctors
- 60% of U.S. jobs are vulnerable to automation
- Cyborgs are when humans and technology merge, enhancing our intellect and physiology
- The next evolutionary step might be the transition from biological to digital, where you conscious is uploaded to a computer after death
