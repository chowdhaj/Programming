Notes
-----

- One of the largest electro-mechanical computers built was the Harvard Mark I; containing 765,000 components, three million connections, and five hundred miles of wire
- Relays were used to open and close circuits
- Mechanical computers wore over time, increasing failure rate, and replacement
- The term "Computer Bug" comes from scientists finding a moth in one of the Harvard Mark I's relay
- Vacuum tubes took over mechanical relays; however, they're subject to their own limitations such as burn out
- First large scale use of computing was the Colossus Mark I designed by Tommy Flowers
- Alan Turning, father of computer science, created The Bombe, an electromechanical machine used to decrypt Nazi enigma code
- The ENIAC was the first general purpose, truly programmable, electronic computer
- The ZI, by Konrad Zuse, is the first Turing complete computer
- Transistor is a switch that can be opened or closed by applying electrical power via a control wire (semiconductor)
- The most common material to create transistors is Silicon; hence the term Silicon Valley
- William Shockley moved to Silicon Valley to create Shockley Semiconductor, whose employees later founded Fairchild Semiconductor, and its employees later founded Intel and AMD
