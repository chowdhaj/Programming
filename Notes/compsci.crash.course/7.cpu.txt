Notes
-----

- The CPU is the heart of the computer - its job is to execute programs, programs such as Microsoft Word, Safari, etc.
- Each program is made up of instructions, b/c they instruct the computer on what to do
- Registers are used to temporarily store and manipulate values
- The Instruction Address Register keeps track of where you are in a program by storing the memory address of the current instruction
- The Instruction Register stores the current instruction (i.e. The data in memory)
- The first phase of a CPU's operation is called the fetch phase, where the first instruction is fetched
- The second phase of a CPU is called the decode phase, where the instruction is broken into opcode and data
- Instructions are interpreted and decoded by a control unit, which is also made out of logic gates
- The last phase of a CPU is called the execute phase, where the instruction is carried out (i.e. Load from memory, add registers, etc.)
- The control unit is responsible for operating the CPU, kind of like a musical conductor. It reads/writes values from/into the ALU, registers, memory, etc. 
- The control unit has its own registers to store values after recieving them from the ALU
- The responsibility of keeping the CPU ticking falls to a component called the clock
- The clock triggers an electrical signal at precise and regular intervals. This signal is used by the control unit to advance the internal operation of the CPU
- The speed at which a CPU carries out EACH STEP of the fetch-decode-execute cycle is called its clock speed. In other words, clock speed is a measure of how fast it takes a CPU to carry out one instruction. Clock speed is measured in Hertz (Hz); measured in cycles per second
- The first single-CPU chip was the Intel 4004. It had a clock speed of 740 KHz
- Overclocking a CPU is modifying the clock to speed up the tempo of the CPU. This can cause overheating
- Modern CPUs can change their clock speed, based on demand. This is called dynamic frequency scaling
- Basic mechanics found in old CPUs are still used in modern CPUs. The architecture hasn't changed much
