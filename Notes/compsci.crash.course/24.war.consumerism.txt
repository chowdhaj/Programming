Notes
-----

- In the 1950s, consumers started to buy transister gadgets like the transistor radio
- The soviets launched the world's first satellite into orbit, Sputnik One, in 1957, and a few years later in 1961, Soviet Cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space
- NASA constructed the Apollo Guidance Computer to help guide the rocket(s) through space. Since the computer had to be fast, reliable, and durable, they turned to transistors and integrated circuits
- Government funding during the cold war enabled early adoption of many nascent computing technologies. This funding helped flow entire industries related to computing long enough for the technology to mature and become commercially feasible for businesses and ultimately consumers
