Notes
-----

- Random Access Memory (RAM) stores information, as long as the power stays on
- Persistent memory can survive without power
- Gates are used to store bits of information; OR gate stores 1; AND gate stores 0. These two are combined to form the AND-OR LATCH
- The action putting data into memory is called writing
- Getting data out of memory is called reading
- The write-enable line keeps the memory in a state of read-only mode, where the bit can be read, but not changed
- A group of latches operating is called a register, which holds a single number, and the number of bits in a register is called width
- Static Random Access Memory uses latches to store bits
- Other types of RAM include DRAM, Flash Memory, and NVRAM
