- Every minute, 3.5 million videos are viewed on YouTube, and 400 hours of new video get uploaded
- Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) have become incredibly widespread
- Domain models can be used to assist learners on any individual problem, but they're insufficient for helping learners move through a whole curriculum because they don't track any progress over time
