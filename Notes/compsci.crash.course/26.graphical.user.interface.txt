Notes
-----

- Apple's Macintosh person computer was the first computer a regular person could buy with a graphical user interface and a mouse to interact with it
- The true forefather of modern GUIs was Douglas Engelbart
- Douglas Engelbart and Bill Englush created the very first computer mouse. The wire came from the bottom of the device and looked very much like a rodent, and the nickname stuck
- The first true GUI computer was developed at Xerox PARC, the Xerox Alto
- The Xerox's answer to GUI computers was to treat the 2D screen like the top of a desk or desktop. The engineers created a WIMP interface; an interface with windows, icons, menus, and a pointer
- GUIs use event-driven programming; code can execute at any time and in different orders, in response to events (i.e. Clicks, Scrolling, etc.)
- Xerox introduced the terms: Cut, Copy, & Paste
- What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) was Xerox's motto for printing. The hard copy should look similar to the soft copy
