- Compression squeezes data into a smaller size
- Run Length Encoding compresses data by reducing repeated or redundant information. This type of compression takes advantage of the fact that there are often runs of identical values in files
- Compression that doesn't lose any data is called lossless compression. The decompressed data is identical to the original data
- Huffman trees are another type of lossless compression. They work by categorizing data into trees, from most common to least. 
- Examples of lossless file formats: GIF, PNG, PDF, ZIP, etc.
- Lossy audio compressors encode different frequency bands at different precisions. This is because there are some sound frequencies that humans cannot hear, like ultrasound
- As signal quality or bandwidth gets worse, compression algorithms remove more data, further reducing precision
- The idea of discarding or reducing precision in a manner that aligns with human perception is called perceptual coding
- JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group
- JPEG compresses images by breaking them up into blocks of 8x8 pixels, and then discarding a lot of the high-frequency spatial data
- Videos are long sequences of images, so a lot of image compression techniques apply to them
- Temporal redundancy is used when the background stays the same, so those pixels don't need to be re-transmitted every frame of the video, just the different patches of data. This takes advantage of inter-frame similarity
- MPEG-4 videos, a common standard, are often 20 to 200 times smaller than the original, uncompressed file
- Compressing to much can distort the quality and sometimes cause things to go horriby wrong
