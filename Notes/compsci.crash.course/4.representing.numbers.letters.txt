Notes
-----

- In binary, a 1 or 0 is called a bit (Binary Digit)
- 8 bits form a byte
- Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte, etc. are all used to express data size/capacity
- 1000 bytes is a Kilobyte
- 1024 bytes is a Kibibyte (Old measurement; now replaced by Kilobyte)
- Modern computers are either 32-bit or 64-bit. This refers to the size of the numbers it can work with
- Negative numbers are represented using a sign bit. The sign bit refers to the first bit. If its 1, its negative, if its 0, its positive
- Locations in memory are known as address. This is helpful for storing and retrieving values
- Decimal numbers are represented using Floating Point Numbers; the decimal "floats" and can be moved anywhere in the number
- Floating point numbers are represented using standards, the most common of which, the IEEE 754 standard
- ASCII is used to encode letters, digits, symbols, etc. An ASCII table outlines all values with their character pair
- Unicode is a universal encoding scheme that replaced all other international formats
- Every single piece of data, whether its videos, images, games, operating systems, etc., everything can be represented using 1's and 0's
