 * Now we have two 'Child' classes, extending the 'Parent' class
 * This class also has access to the methods and attributes of the 'Parent' class
 * In essence, we are using ONE line of code in TWO different places [inheritance allows for maximum code reuse-ability] 
 * And if needed to change eye color to blue, we know exactly where to go
