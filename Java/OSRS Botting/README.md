# OSRS Botting

This repo contains basic and intermediate scripts used to create `bots` for OldSchool RuneScape.
Some scripts were developed for OSRSbot (OSBot), and some were developed for DreamBot (DB).
Advanced scripts with multi-level intelligence were abandoned due to the developers of the
botting clients not providing enough anti-detection measures.
