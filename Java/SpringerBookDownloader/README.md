# Springer Website Scraper

During the COVID pandemic, Springer released dozens of books for free, for students to learn remotely.
This application scrapes Springer's websites and downloads free books. It probably does not work
anymore, but the code can be adapted to do other things. Also, if anyone is interested in the
free books, please send me a message; I have them downloaded.
