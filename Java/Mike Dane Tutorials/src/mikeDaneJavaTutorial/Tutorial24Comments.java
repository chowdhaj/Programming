 * NOTES *
 * * * * * 
 * Comments are (non-code) lines that are meant to be 
 *     read by other humans
 * Comments are ignored by the Java compiler
 * Comments can be used to:
 *     Temporarily disable (non-functional) code
 *     Provide insightful feedback on what the code is doing
 *     Serve as a TODO list on what needs to be done
 *     Anything else you can imagine!
 * To create a comment, type two forward slashes:
 *     // This is a comment
 * You can also create multi-line comments, just like this 
 *     entire 'Notes' section. Multi-line comments can span
 *     multiple lines
 * You can write comments after code:
 *     String name = "Bob"; // This is a name
 * Comments should be used sparingly, and only IF the code needs
 *     to be explained. In general, write code that is clean, 
 *     concise and easy to understand/read
