Assumptions:
    - Variable names were changed to reflect the data type. I like to give my variables 
      a relevant name because it makes debugging easier and increases maintainability
    - I created a method that prints Arrays. This makes it easier to debug and test
    - The elapsed time for sorting is always 0.001. I am unsure why this is happening
      and the TA was also unsure. However, I understand that Selection sort is O(N^2).
    
Notes:

Classification Of Algorithms  
	- Constant - 1 - The algorithm executes a fixed number of statements to finish the job.
	   				   For example: Adding two numbers.
	- Logarithmic N - Log N - The algorithm finishes in Log N time, where N is the size of
							  the list. It is slightly slower than constant time. An example
							  is Binary Search.
	- Linear - N - The algorithm iterates through the entire list and time is dependent on
	 			   the size of the list. An example is finding a particular element in a list
	- Linearithmic - N * Log N - Examples are Merge Sort and Quick Sort
	- Quadratic - N^2 - The algorithm has two nested loops. For example: Finding all possible
	 				    cartesian combinations of two lists. Algorithms like selection sort
	 				    and insertion sort have a time of N^2.
    - Cubic - N^3 - The algorithm has 3 nested loosps.
    - Exponential 2^N - This algorithm is really slow and usually cannot be completed for a large
    					problem. However, there are problems in CS where exponential is the only
    					solution

RunTime
	- Can be measured using the difference between System time.
	- There is a method called currentTimeMillis
	- nanoTime can also be used but causes issues on multi-cores
