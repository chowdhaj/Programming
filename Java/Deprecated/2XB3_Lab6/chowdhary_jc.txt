Assumptions:

	- The 'getters' for the Money class were renamed and the word 
	  'get' was added in the beginning. This is because these methods
	  are 'getters' and naming them with a 'get' makes it more clear.
	  
	- Variables were renamed to be more descriptive. For example,
	  'aMoney' was changed to 'diffMoney'.
	
	- Comments were added for clarity
