Assumptions:

	- A toString method was added to SelectionSort. It converts
	  the Comparable to a string, making it 'printable'. Also,
	  this method is private so it is only accessible inside
	  the SelectionSort class. I did this to hide it from the
	  JUnit Testing Class.
	- Answers to questions are inside the respective java classes
	- I am assuming that deprecated methods are allowed to be used
	- Most of the methods from SelectionSort.java were copied
	  directly into BubbleSort.java. Everything worked flawlessly.
	- The test cases for BubbleSort.java are identical to the
	  test cases for SelectionSort.java. This is because the test
	  cases are more than adequate and cover edge cases.
	- The code for ShellSort.java was taken straight from the 
	  textbook. The remaining functions were copied from 
	  SelectionSort.java and BubbleSort.java
	- The test cases for sorting algorithms use the AssertEquals
	  method, even though it has been deprecated. 
	- The input for ShellSort is assumed to be a double, and all
	  Integers get converted into Floating point values.
	- The Scanner and PrintWriter are closed at the end of execution,
	  to prevent memory leaks.
	
(You can ignore everything after this)
	
Notes:

	- An algorithm is a procedure that takes input and 
	  produces output. For example: Sorting a sequence 
	  of numbers
	- An algorithm describes a specific computational procedure
	  for achieving a desired IO relationship
