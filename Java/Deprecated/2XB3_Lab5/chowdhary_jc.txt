Assumptions:

	- Package name renamed to 'cas.lab5.wt' because package names cannot 
	  start with a number. Thus, the '2XB3' had to be dropped.
	  
	- Comments were added for clarity, even though they are not specified in
	  the walk-through. However, adding comments is good coding practice. 
	  Therefore, I decided to add them. 
	  
	- The accessor methods were renamed to 'getX' and 'getY'. This is because
	  this the convention set by the Java industry experts. They call these
	  getter methods. 
	  
	- The 'distanceTo' method was implemented differently. I calculated the
	  power by using the Math library's 'pow' function. I did this because
	  using libraries are efficient; why reinvent the wheel?
	  
	- The output text to console was aligned and formatted to make it more
	  aesthetically pleasing. 
	  
	- More test cases were added to test the robustness of the programs. This
	  is not referring to data/input.txt
