## HTML & CSS
- Synopsis
    - Hypertext Markup Language and Cascading Stylesheets are the bread and butter of the web. In order to create (basic) web pages, you need to know HTML and CSS. Once you get good with these two, move on to JavaScript.

## JavaScript
- Synopsis
    - The entire web runs off of JavaScript. This is the next step in your web development career. With JavaScript, you can build Full-Stack applications (Frontend + Backend). Finally, JavaScript contains more packages/libraries/frameworks than all the other languages - even more than Python!

## React
- Synopsis
    - React is a Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Meta (i.e. Facebook). Why learn it? Because it is **very** popular, and bankrolled by a lot of (big) companies.

## React Native
- Synopsis
    - React Native enables developers to build real native mobile apps for iOS and Android. The major benefit is that you no longer have to maintain two separate code bases. There are lots of benefits to React Native; for the full list, use Google.

## Angular
- Synopsis
    - Just like React, Angular is a Frontend JavaScript library. It is used by big companies, and was bankrolled by Google until they killed it. However, all those systems built in Angular aren't going to be converted into React overnight, and someone needs to maintain that code. Even though React is a better framework to learn, at the very least you should know the basics of Angular.

## TypeScript
- Synopsis
    - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, developed and maintained by Microsoft (another big company). TypeScript was designed for the development of large applications. The benefit of TypeScript is that it allows developers to catch errors early in the development cycle.

## Node.js
- Synopsis
    - Node is a Backend JavaScript runtime environment that runs on Google's open source V8 engine. The purpose of Node is to run JavaScript outside of a browser. Node represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, which allows developers to create Full-Stack applications in JavaScript.

## Databases
- Synopsis
    - All companies, big and small, use databases to store information (e.g. usernames, password, age, birthday, credit cards, etc). Being able to query databases is a must for a Full-Stack developer.

## Docker 
- Synopsis
    - The biggest issue with programming today is code breaking due to updates, unsupported hardware, software, etc. With Docker, all of the aforementioned issues are eliminated. Docker containerizes your application to run in the same environment everytime. So whether you are building, developing, or deploying, you can be confident that your application will "just work".

## Git
- Synopsis
    - Version control software is extremely powerful, and is widely used in tech. The most popular version control software is Git, and the most popular repository is GitHub. Learning Git is essential when working with other people on a project.

## AWS-EC2 Deployment
- Synopsis
    - Once you have developed at least one Full-Stack application, the next step is to deploy it. Amazon's EC2 is the most popular choice for hosting web applications. Learning AWS-EC2 is essential for landing a job, because a lot of companies rely on Amazon.
    - *Fun fact: Amazon hosts the CIA's data.*
